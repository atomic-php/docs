# Introduction

Atomic PHP is a collection of high‑performance, PSR‑friendly libraries. It prioritizes compile‑time optimizations and zero‑overhead execution paths.

## Philosophy

- Performance over abstraction; compile‑time where possible
- Small, composable components with clear responsibilities
- PSR‑first: PSR‑7/11/12/15 compliance

## Packages

- HTTP Kernel — PSR‑15 kernel with compile‑time middleware pipelines
- Router — Blazingly fast PSR‑7/15 router with static and parameterized routes
- Container — Lightweight PSR‑11 container
